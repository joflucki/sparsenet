``sparsenet.linear``
===========================

The ``sparsenet.linear`` package contains all the code relevant to linear function optimization,
as opposed to the ``sparsenet.nn``, which contains the code relevant to neural networks.

Linear function optimization is used as a stepping stone to first understand the concepts of training loop, optimizers, and losses in PyTorch.
