SparseNet is a compact library built on PyTorch designed to facilitate the training of sparse models using algorithms such as ISTA. Developed in the context of research at the University of Geneva's Section of Mathematics, this library was implemented by Jonas Flückiger from the HE-Arc University of Applied Sciences as part of his bachelor's thesis.

SparseNet offers tools for creating sparse datasets, training linear models and neural networks, and provides numerous examples and use cases. These tools are available as a Python package, while the examples and scripts are hosted in the Git repository.

This documentation includes instructions for installing and using the SparseNet library, as well as comprehensive API documentation for developers. Each module is described in detail within the API documentation, with additional information on the implementation of specific algorithms where necessary.
